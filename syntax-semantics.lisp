;; These are my notes on reading the syntax-and-semantics chapter


;; Because names can contain many more characters in Lisp than they can in Algol-derived languages, certain naming conventions are distinct to Lisp, such as the use of hyphenated names like hello-world. Another important convention is that global variables are given names that start and end with *. Similarly, constants are given names starting and ending in +. And some programmers will name particularly low-level functions with names that start with % or even %%. The names defined in the language standard use only the alphabetic characters (A-Z) plus *, +, -, /, 1, 2, <, =, >, and &.
